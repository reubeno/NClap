Welcome! NClap is a .NET library for parsing command-line arguments and building interactive
command shells. It's driven by a declarative attribute syntax, and easy to extend.
It's sort of like a lightweight serializer for command-line arguments.

It's also very much under active development, and we welcome contributions! We're still writing
up some notes and tips about contributing to the project, how to run our unit tests, etc. But in the
meantime, don't be shy! Please go right ahead and file issues, drop us a line, submit pull requests,
etc.

## Getting NClap

The easiest way to consume NClap is by adding its [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NClap) to your project.
It is built for use with .NET 4.6.1+ and .NET Core 1.1.
